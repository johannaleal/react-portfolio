## Description

In this homework, I updated my portfolio page to use React. I modified my portfolio to include a Navbar, ProjectCard, and Footer component. The ProjectCard component is used to populate the Portfolio page. The functionality is as follows:

* Each page has a basic Bootstrap nav bar, footer, and main component.
* The About page includes an image of me, a blurb about me, and sidebar with links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and a link to download my resume in PDF format.
* The Portfolio page consists of screenshots of six projects that I have completed.
* Each project card contains a screenshot, a brief description, a link to the GitHub repo, and a link to the deployed app.
* The Contact page contains several input fields and a submit button.
